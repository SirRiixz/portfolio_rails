I have made my own LOGO and as a favicom included on my slides presentation file
but did not put the favicom on


The main bugs i've been having at first
was that my pictures weren't showing and then after fixing that another problem had occurred, my pictures was all over the place, then my last problem was the letters overlap in mobile mode.

At the moment i do not know how to fix this last problem.
